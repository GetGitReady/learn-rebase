Need to Rebase
- Feature branches are created based on the latest commit in main
- When the feature development is in progress, there are other commits added to main by merges from other members
- This situation could cause merge conflicts and makes the testing of feature less reliable
- Rebasing soles this problem 

What is rebase (example)
- Feature branches are created based on the latest commit (say commit x) in main
- When the feature development is in progress, there are other commits added to main by merges from other members
- Lets say the latest commit on main is y
- The feature branch is based on the commit x of main branch.
- Changing the feature branch to be based on the commit y of the main branch is rebasing
